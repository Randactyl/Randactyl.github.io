        Hi. My name is Randy. This is my last class! I work as a process automation developer. As you might see from my <a href="https://github.com/Randactyl">GitHub repositories</a> I have a good deal of experience writing code, but only a slight familiarity with building web pages. This class should be a nice refresher on the basics of building web pages and composing whole sites.
